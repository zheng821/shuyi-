### 1. Who collected the data?

The data was collected by Inside Airbnb (IA) using an AI-powered search algorithms and presented it in a zip file. 

### 2. Why did they collect it?

The main objective of collecting the data by Airbnb is to calculate prices, and rank the best match for a user. By collecting the data Airbnb is able to present data for analysis. The analysed data is used by Airbnb to make better recommendations and match the right people together. The data need to be columna

### 3. How was it collected?

The Airbnb artificial intelligence algorithm scrap data on the characteristics of a listing such as location, key benefits, price and the reviews from previous occupants. The data is then combined with information from search pattern of people visiting their website. They then log the time of extraction of the data and the preferences of the visitors. The final data was then combined into a json file format and other easily convertible formats such as csv. 

### 4. What useful information does it contain?

The data contains information on the date when the host started being part of the Airbnb - This is information is useful in analysing the experience of the hosts with visitors. The second important variable is the location and picture of the facility. This helps in making decisions on which competing houses to choose. Third, contains information on the response rate of the host this allows users to decide on the best hosts with high response rate. The fourth useful variable is the status of the identity of the hosts. Verified hosts are attractive since the visitor have a sense of security.

### 5. To what extent is the data 'complete'?

The data is within 10% of the actual values or features. this estimate comes from the reported estimates by Airbnb data scientist. Some of the variables in the data are self-reported such as type of the property. The information is are described by the host. The other variables are calculated implying they are estimates. These variables include the smallest minimum night value from the calendar and the smallest maximum night value from the calendar. Further, the data on availability of the listing in the next 30 days and 60 days. However, the completeness of the information in the data depends on each variable selected. Some of the most important variables include price (continuous), longitude (continuous), latitude (continuous), listing_type (categorical), is_superhost (categorical), neighbourhood (categorical), and ratings (continuous). A glance at these variables shows that there exists missing values. Therefore, the data is not 100% completed but has more than 90% complete cases. 

### 6. What kinds of analysis would this support?

The data would support predictive and machine learning analysis. The predictive analysis refers to the application of data, statistical algorithms and machine learning approach to identify the probability of future outcomes based on previous observed data. In this case the future process or probability of a user choosing a particular listing can be calculated using this data. The Airbnb data contains enough data point for successful application of machine learning algorithms. The other form of analysis that the data can support is the text mining or analysis. The reviews can be analysed based on the response from the reviewers. This can inform future decisions on a property. Some of the variables include free text responses which can be used in sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis can study the customers’ behaviour to some extent and can somewhat replace the time- and money-consuming traditional methods like surveys and focus groups. Sentiment analysis is a technique to discover people’s emotional state from text data. By just analysing the easily accessible sources of data, sentiment analysis can give the business owners relatively accurate feedbacks to measure the customers’ tendencies. The information derived from the data can be used in guiding decisions of how much to charge. 

### 7. Which of the uses presented in Q.6 are _ethical_?

Sentimental analysis is one of the unethical uses of the data. The results can be used by Airbnb for potential commercial gain. A group or individuals may be impacted negatively by the decisions made by the company. The hosts whose houses received negative reviews may end up not being suggested to the customers by the system. Some of the reviews might not portray the actual happenings and if the information is used to make decisions on which listing to highlight to potential customers, then the hosts or group of hosts might end up not getting any customers. Next, the reviews are personal experiences of customers and the use of their information without consent in making commercial gains violates their privacy.
The second analysis which is unethical is predictive analysis. The Machine learning can ascertain a lot about an individual visiting Airbnb website. Some of the information include personal bio data such as gender, race and sexual orientation. It has been reported that machine learning can predict an individual’s sexual orientation, whether they are pregnant, whether they will buy a product or not. This information influences how an individual makes decision and with this information Airbnb can manipulate a client to select a listing which does not meet all their preferences. Wrong use of the information from machine learning algorithms can have a significant impact on someone’s life or the behaviour of a group of people.
